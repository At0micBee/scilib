> A rust crate for mathematics and science

## Overview

This crate is designed to help any mathematical or scientific process for the rust community. It compiles many useful concepts and items that are key in scientific applications, such as Bessel functions, statistical analysis, physical constants, etc...

The aim is to provide classical functions in pure Rust, for ease of operability.

## Work in progress

As of the creation of this readme, I am working on this project alone which means a few things:

1. The progression will be linked to my schedule
2. I will work firsts on concept with which I am familiar with
3. I am a self-taught developer, and thus some solutions could be sub-optimal and thus improved
