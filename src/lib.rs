//!
//! ## Introduction
//! 
//! > A rust crate for mathematics and science
//! 
//! This library aims at improving the state of the scientific viability of Rust. A number of key function
//! are missing that are hindering the use of the language in certain domains, despite the numerous
//! advantages of the language.
//! 
//! This crate will provide both simple, and advanced concept (from constants to spherical harmonics functions)
//! that will hopefully help many science developers.
//! 
//! > **Before you use**: this crate is currently a work in progress and is thus missing many features. I will do my best to ensure
//! both fast and correct computation, but it is evident that improvements could be found in the future. I will
//! first implement concept I am familiar with, and work towards other domains later on.
